        Pirates of the Caribbean is a series of fantasy swashbuckler films produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and based on
        Walt Disney's theme park attraction of the same name. The film series serves as a major component of the
        eponymous media franchise.
        Directors of the series include Gore Verbinski (films 1–3), Rob Marshall (4), Joachim Rønning (5–6), and Espen
        Sandberg (5). The series is primarily written by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (1–4); other writers include
        Stuart Beattie (1), Jay Wolpert (1),
        Jeff Nathanson (5), and Craig Mazin (6). The stories follow the adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny
        Depp), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). Characters such as Hector Barbossa
        (Geoffrey Rush) and Joshamee Gibbs
        (Kevin McNally) follow Jack, Will and Elizabeth in the course of the films. The fourth film features Blackbeard
        (Ian McShane) and Angelica (Penélope Cruz), while the fifth film features Armando Salazar (Javier Bardem), Henry
        Turner (Brenton Thwaites) and Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario).
        The films take place in a fictionalized version of the Golden Age of Piracy, and are set primarily in the
        Caribbean.
    </p>

    <p class="p2">
        The film series started in 2003 with Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, which was met with
        a positive reception from both audience and film critics and grossed US$654 million worldwide.[1] After the
        first film's success, Walt Disney Pictures revealed that a film series was in the works.
        The franchise's second film, subtitled Dead Man's Chest, was released three years later in 2006; the sequel
        proved successful, breaking financial records worldwide the day of its premiere. Dead Man's Chest ended up being
        the number one film of the year upon earning almost $1.1 billion at the worldwide box office. The third film in
        the series,
        subtitled At World's End, followed in 2007 earning $960 million, and Disney released a fourth film, subtitled On
        Stranger Tides, in 2011 in conventional 2D, Digital 3-D and IMAX 3D.
        On Stranger Tides succeeded in also grossing more than $1 billion,[1] becoming the second film in the franchise
        and only the eighth film in history to achieve this.
        The franchise has grossed over $4.5 billion worldwide;[1] it is the 14th-highest-grossing film series of all
        time, and is the first film franchise to produce two or more movies that grossed over $1 billion.

    <h1>Films</h1>


    <div class="p3" style="color: black;">

        <h2><b>First film</b></h2>

        <p>In the early 1990s[13] screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio conceived a supernatural spin on the pirate
            genre after completing work on Aladdin, but there was no interest from any studio. Undeterred, the writing
            team refused to give up the dream, waiting for a studio to pick up their take on a pirate tale.[14] Disney
            had Jay Wolpert write a script based on the Pirates of the Caribbean, which producer Jerry Bruckheimer
            rejected, feeling it was "a straight pirate movie".[15] Bruckheimer brought Stuart Beattie in to rewrite the
            script in March 2002, due to his knowledge of piracy,[16] and later that month Elliott and Rossio were
            brought in.[15] Elliott and Rossio, inspired by the opening narration of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride,
            decided to give the film a supernatural edge.[17] As the budget rose, Michael Eisner and Robert Iger
            threatened to cancel the film, though Bruckheimer changed their minds when he showed them concept art and
            animatics.[18]

            In June 2002 Gore Verbinski signed on to direct The Curse of the Black Pearl, and Johnny Depp and Geoffrey
            Rush signed on the following month to star.[16] Verbinski was attracted to the idea of using modern
            technology to resurrect a genre, one that had disappeared after the Golden Age of Hollywood, and recalled
            his childhood memories of the ride, feeling the film was an opportunity to pay tribute to the "scary and
            funny" tone of it. Depp was attracted to the story as he found it quirky: rather than trying to find
            treasure, the crew of the Black Pearl were trying to return it in order to lift their curse; also, the
            traditional mutiny had already taken place. Verbinski approached Rush for the role of Barbossa, as he knew
            he would not play it with attempts at complexity, but with a simple villainy that would suit the story's
            tone.[19] Orlando Bloom read the script after Rush, with whom he was working on Ned Kelly, suggested it to
            him.[20] Keira Knightley came as a surprise to Verbinski: he had not seen her performance in Bend It Like
            Beckham and was impressed by her audition.[19] Tom Wilkinson was negotiated with to play Governor Swann,[16]
            but the role went to Jonathan Pryce, whom Depp idolized.[19]

            Shooting for The Curse of the Black Pearl began on October 9, 2002 and wrapped by March 7, 2003.[16] Before
            its release, many executives and journalists had expected the film to flop, as the pirate genre had not been
            successful for years, the film was based on a theme-park ride, and Depp rarely made a big film.[21] However,
            The Curse of the Black Pearl became both a critical and commercial success.
        </p>
        <h2><b>Second and third films</b> </h2>
        <p>After seeing how well the first film was made, the cast and crew signed for two sequels to be shot
            back-to-back,[22] a practical decision on Disney's part to allow more time with the same cast and crew.[23]
            Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio knew that with an ensemble cast, they weren't free to invent totally
            different situations and characters, as with the Indiana Jones and James Bond series, and so had to
            retroactively turn The Curse of the Black Pearl into the first of a trilogy.[24] They wanted to explore the
            reality of what would happen after Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's embrace at the end of the first film,
            and initially considered the Fountain of Youth as the plot device.[25] They settled on introducing Davy
            Jones, the Flying Dutchman and the Kraken, a mythology mentioned twice in the first film. They introduced
            the fictional East India Trading Company as the primary antagonists (being only mentioned in the first
            film), which for them represented a counterpoint to the themes of personal freedom represented by
            pirates.[26]

            Filming for the sequels began on February 28, 2005,[27] with Dead Man's Chest finishing on March 1,
            2006,[28] and At World's End on January 10, 2007.[29] The second film was also the first Disney theatrical
            feature film with the computer-generated Walt Disney Pictures logo.[30]
        </p>
        <h2><b>Fourth film</b></h2>
        <p> Rossio and Elliot discovered the novel On Stranger Tides during production of Dead Man's Chest and At
            World's End and decided to use it as the basis for a fourth film. As Gore Verbinski was unavailable,
            Bruckheimer invited Rob Marshall to direct the film.[31] Elliott and Rossio decided to do a stand-alone
            film,[32] with a story that would support new characters,[33] and incorporate elements from the novel, such
            as Edward "Blackbeard" Thatch, the Fountain of Youth and mermaids—the latter two having been already alluded
            to in the previous films.[34] Depp, Rush, Greg Ellis and Kevin McNally returned to their roles,[35] and the
            cast saw the additions of Ian McShane as Blackbeard and Penélope Cruz as Angelica, Blackbeard's daughter and
            Jack Sparrow's love interest.[36] A further addition was Richard Griffiths as King George II of Great
            Britain. After the costly production of two simultaneous films, Disney tried to scale down the fourth
            installment, giving a lower budget,[37] which led to cheaper locations and fewer scenes with special
            effects.[38] However, with a budget of $378.5 million, On Stranger Tides holds the record for most expensive
            film ever made.

            Filming for On Stranger Tides began June 14, 2010, and ended on November 19, 2010.[38][39] It was also
            filmed in 3D, with cameras similar to the ones used in Avatar.[31]

            It was released in the United States on May 20, 2011.[40]
        </p>
        <h2><b>Fifth film</b></h2>
        <p>On January 14, 2011, it was confirmed that Terry Rossio would write the screenplay for the fifth installment,
            without his co-writer Ted Elliott.[41] On January 11, 2013, Jeff Nathanson signed on to write the script for
            the film. On May 29, 2013, it was announced that Norwegian directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg were
            selected to direct.[42] On August 22, 2013, the two revealed that the title of the fifth film would be Dead
            Men Tell No Tales, alluding to the line well known from the Pirates of the Caribbean theme-park
            attraction.[43][44][45] The film was given an alternative title, Salazar's Revenge, in selected European,
            South American, and Asian countries for marketing purposes.[46] They also confirmed that they were working
            on the film, speaking highly of Jeff Nathanson's "funny and touching" script and that they are inspired by
            the first film, The Curse of the Black Pearl.[47][48] On September 10, 2013, Disney pushed back the film's
            initial 2015 release,[49] with sources indicating that a Summer 2016 release was likely.[50] Producer Jerry
            Bruckheimer revealed that script issues were behind the delay and that Jeff Nathanson was at work on a
            second attempt based on a well-received outline.[51]

            A spokesman for the Australian Arts Minister confirmed that the fifth installment was set to shoot in
            Australia after the government agreed to repurpose $20 million of tax incentives originally intended for the
            remake of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.[52] Disney and Ian Walker the Queensland Arts Minister, confirmed on
            October 2, 2014, that filming was expected to start in February 2015, stating that filming will take place
            exclusively in Australia, being the largest production to ever shoot in the country. Village Roadshow
            Studios and Port Douglas were officially confirmed as filming locations.[53] Production began in Australia
            on February 17, 2015, and wrapped on July 9, 2015.[54]

            While Disney originally announced a release on July 7, 2017,[55][56] Dead Men Tell No Tales was released on
            May 26, 2017.[57]</p>
